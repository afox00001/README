Charity Lartius: Ran a validator to html pages and fixed some of the codes.  **Learning reflections:** Effective communication plays a vital role in project teamwork, and Git provides solid and consistent channels for collaboration. Regarding code modification, branching, and pull requests, help track those changes. The collaborative feature encourages each team member to contribute, resulting in diverse and smoother integration of work. Additionally, resolving conflicts when merging is beneficial as it fosters patience and problem-solving abilities.
Madeline Holmberg: Changed the Register button to Enroll and added an Unenroll feature when the Enroll button is clicked. **Learning reflections:** This project enhanced my understanding of collaborative development, as everyone was involved in reviewing and approving changes. Overall, I learned the importance of structure and teamwork in maintaining a smooth development process.
