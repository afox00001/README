Charity Lartius: Ran a validator to html pages and fixed some of the codes.  **Learning reflections:** Effective communication plays a vital role in project teamwork, and Git provides solid and consistent channels for collaboration. Regarding code modification, branching, and pull requests, help track those changes. The collaborative feature encourages each team member to contribute, resulting in diverse and smoother integration of work. Additionally, resolving conflicts when merging is beneficial as it fosters patience and problem-solving abilities.
Madeline Holmberg: Changed the Register button to Enroll and added an Unenroll feature when the Enroll button is clicked. **Learning reflections:** This project enhanced my understanding of collaborative development, as everyone was involved in reviewing and approving changes. Overall, I learned the importance of structure and teamwork in maintaining a smooth development process.
Jack Kantola: Made adjustments to the footer styles because there was content appearing on either side of the footer and a gap between the body and the footer when scrolled to the bottom of the page. To fix this I changed the position to "fixed" so it can be positioned outside of the parent element (body). I changed the width to 100% and shifted the footer left 8px (the default body margin) to remove the gaps on either side. Finally I had to increase the bottom margin of the body to eliminate overlap between the footer and the content because the footer was taken out of the HTML "flow". **Learning reflections:** Github Desktop provides tools for effectivbe collaberation. I also found that review changes should be carefully reviewed before making pull requests. Initially I did not increase the body bottom margin so there was some content was covered up. This would have been avoided if I have took the proper amount of time needed to verify that nothing undesired changed.
