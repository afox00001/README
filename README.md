The website consits of five pages, each with a HTML element or CSS style to showcaase. Admissions is for forms, programs is identifiers, directory is tables, and register is flow. Bug fixes are made as needed through branches.

**Charity Lartius:** Ran a validator to html pages and fixed some of the codes.  **Learning reflections:** Effective communication plays a vital role in project teamwork, and Git provides solid and consistent channels for collaboration. Regarding code modification, branching, and pull requests, help track those changes. The collaborative feature encourages each team member to contribute, resulting in diverse and smoother integration of work. Additionally, resolving conflicts when merging is beneficial as it fosters patience and problem-solving abilities.

**Madeline Holmberg:** Changed the Register button to Enroll and added an Unenroll feature when the Enroll button is clicked. **Learning reflections:** This project enhanced my understanding of collaborative development, as everyone was involved in reviewing and approving changes. Overall, I learned the importance of structure and teamwork in maintaining a smooth development process.

**Jack Kantola:** Made adjustments to the footer styles because there was content appearing on either side of the footer and a gap between the body and the footer when scrolled to the bottom of the page. To fix this I changed the position to "fixed" so it can be positioned outside of the parent element (body). I changed the width to 100% and shifted the footer left 8px (the default body margin) to remove the gaps on either side. Finally I had to increase the bottom margin of the body to eliminate overlap between the footer and the content because the footer was taken out of the HTML "flow". **Learning reflections:** Github Desktop provides tools for effectivbe collaberation. I also found that review changes should be carefully reviewed before making pull requests. Initially I did not increase the body bottom margin so there was some content was covered up. This would have been avoided if I have took the proper amount of time needed to verify that nothing undesired changed.

**Jackson Krone:** **Added** I added a couple of javascript functions. The first is a alert when you first load the index.html page. Then I added a onclick to the index.html logo that will bring up the window with the README.md file. Last change for the script was adding a dark background toggle when clicking home navigation on the index.html page. The last change I made was expanding the About Us section with more description on the index.html page. **Learning reflections:** I learned how to collaborate using git/github and the importance of version control for fixing any bugs/error when working on a github project.

**Ashton Fox:** **Added** I updated the navigation to work on all pages. I also fixed the styling for the navigation. **Learning Reflections** I learned how to effectivly collaborate with github. I also learned more about version contro. I learned how to use team work to stramline the development process.
